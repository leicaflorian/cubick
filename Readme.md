# Cubick

This is a simple demo on how to create a rubick cube using **Vanilla JS** and **CSS**.
To use the cube, click on a square and move it around with the arrow keys.

You can even rotate the whole cube by simply click and drag.

The project can be viewed in action here:

## Work in progress
The movements are not perfect and requires a few more work to be done, but is fine as a proof of concept.
The code requires a bit of work to handle correctly the up rotation of face 0, 2, 3
